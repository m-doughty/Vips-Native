=head1 NAME

LLM::Character - Implementation of Character Card v3 characters & lorebooks in Raku

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Vips::Native;

smart-resize("t/fixtures/camelia.png", "t/fixtures/out2.png", 128, 128);

=end code

=head2 STATUS

This module is a very minimal FFI wrapper for libvips for smart image resizing (my use case
was making thumbnails). I may add more functionality later.

Pull requests are welcome if you want to add more vips functionality.

You will need vips installed, I refuse to vendor glib.

On MacOS: brew install vips

On Ubuntu: sudo apt install libvips-dev

=head1 EXTERNAL API

=head2 Vips::Native

=head3 smart-resize(Str $in-path, Str $out-path, Int $out-width, Int $out-height --> Bool)

Takes the input at $in-path, crops it to the right aspect ratio based on attention filter, then 
resizes to $out-width x $out-height and saves it to $out-path as a PNG.
